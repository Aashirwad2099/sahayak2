### GigSuraksha+ – Empowering the Gig Workforce

1. Problem Definition

Gig workers in India (e.g., delivery agents, cab drivers, freelancers) face:

Irregular income and poor access to credit

No career growth support or skilling opportunities

Poor safety mechanisms and health access

Underutilized personal assets (e.g., idle vehicles)

They are excluded from structured financial systems, making them vulnerable.

2. Solution Approach

GigSuraksha+ is an AI-powered mobile application that offers:

Smart Wallet & Credit Builder – Income tracking via Account Aggregator (AA), budget tips, credit scoring

Soft Loans – Low-interest micro-loans using AA data

P2P Vehicle Renting – Workers rent vehicles from each other affordably

Upskilling – Personalized AI-recommended learning paths

Safety Tools – SOS button, danger zone alerts

Health Access – Telehealth, symptom checker, micro-insurance

AI Assistant – Multilingual, voice-based guidance across modules

3. Technical Outline

Frontend: Flutter / React Native

Backend: Node.js / FastAPI

AI/ML: OpenAI, scikit-learn, LSTM, NLP

Database: PostgreSQL, Firebase

APIs: Account Aggregator (Setu), RazorpayX, Maps, Insurance, Telemedicine

Security: Consent-based data sharing, encrypted storage, OTP-authenticated AA flows

Architecture: Mobile App → Backend API → AI Models & Third-party APIs

4. Novelty of the Solution

First app to combine finance, growth, safety, and health for gig workers

Uses AA data to unlock formal credit access

AI assistant is local-language aware and voice-powered

Peer-to-peer vehicle renting builds a gig community micro-economy

Scalable and customizable for government, NGO, or CSR integration


## **WorkerBuild Problem Summary**
