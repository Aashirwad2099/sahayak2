# Employer Login and Agreement Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Unable to Login as Employer**
- **Problem**: LoginPage was hardcoded to only allow "job seeker" role
- **Root Cause**: Role field was disabled and set to a fixed value
- **Fix**: 
  - Added role selection dropdown in LoginPage
  - Updated login redirect logic to handle different user roles
  - Employers now redirect to `/employer-dashboard` after login

### 2. **Unable to View Agreements in Employer Section**
- **Problem**: EmployerAgreementsPage expected employerId prop but didn't receive it
- **Root Cause**: Component wasn't getting user ID from AuthContext
- **Fix**:
  - Updated EmployerAgreementsPage to use AuthContext
  - Added fallback to get employerId from authenticated user
  - Added agreements link to employer navigation

## Files Modified:

### 1. **LoginPage.jsx**
**Changes:**
- Added role selection dropdown (Job Seeker / Job Provider)
- Updated form state to include role
- Enhanced login redirect logic:
  - Providers ‚Üí `/employer-dashboard`
  - Seekers ‚Üí `/skills` (if no skills) or `/profile`
  - Others ‚Üí `/profile`

**Before:**
```jsx
// Hardcoded role field
<input value="job seeker" disabled />

// Single redirect logic
const skillsRes = await API.get(`/user-skills/${res.data.user._id}`);
if (skillsRes.data.length === 0) {
  navigate('/skills');
} else {
  navigate('/profile');
}
```

**After:**
```jsx
// Dynamic role selection
<select name="role" value={form.role} onChange={handleChange}>
  <option value="seeker">Job Seeker</option>
  <option value="provider">Job Provider</option>
</select>

// Role-based redirect logic
if (res.data.user.role === 'provider') {
  navigate('/employer-dashboard');
} else if (res.data.user.role === 'seeker') {
  // Skills check for seekers only
} else {
  navigate('/profile');
}
```

### 2. **EmployerAgreementsPage.jsx**
**Changes:**
- Added `useAuth` hook to get current user
- Updated component to use employerId from AuthContext as fallback
- Made component work both as standalone route and with props

**Before:**
```jsx
const EmployerAgreementsPage = ({ employerId }) => {
  // Component failed if employerId prop wasn't provided
```

**After:**
```jsx
const EmployerAgreementsPage = ({ employerId: propEmployerId }) => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const employerId = propEmployerId || user?._id;
  // Component now works in both scenarios
```

### 3. **EmployerDashboard.jsx**
**Changes:**
- Updated quick action links to use correct routes
- Added "View Agreements" link
- Fixed broken employer profile links

**Links Updated:**
- `/employer/profile` ‚Üí `/employer-profile`
- `/employer/post-job` ‚Üí `/post-job`
- `/employer/my-jobs` ‚Üí `/jobs`
- Added `/employer-agreements` link
- Added `/wallet` link

### 4. **Navbar.jsx**
**Changes:**
- Added "Agreements" link to employer navigation
- Improved employer navigation structure

**Navigation for Employers:**
- Dashboard
- Agreements ‚Üê **NEW**
- Wallet
- Jobs
- Profile

## How the Fixes Work:

### **Login Flow for Employers:**
1. User selects "Job Provider" role in login form
2. Enters credentials and submits
3. Backend authenticates and returns user with role='provider'
4. Frontend detects provider role and redirects to `/employer-dashboard`
5. Employer can access all provider-specific features

### **Agreement Viewing:**
1. Employer navigates to "Agreements" from navbar or dashboard
2. EmployerAgreementsPage loads and gets employerId from AuthContext
3. Component fetches agreements for the current employer
4. Displays agreements with view/sign functionality

### **Navigation Structure:**
- **Seekers**: Skills, Wallet, Tools, Loans, Jobs, Profile
- **Employers**: Dashboard, Agreements, Wallet, Jobs, Profile
- **Both**: Logout functionality

## Testing the Fixes:

### **Test Employer Login:**
1. Go to `/login`
2. Select "Job Provider" from role dropdown
3. Enter employer credentials
4. Should redirect to `/employer-dashboard`
5. Should see employer-specific navigation

### **Test Agreement Viewing:**
1. Login as employer
2. Click "Agreements" in navbar or dashboard
3. Should see EmployerAgreementsPage
4. Should display agreements (if any exist)
5. Should be able to view/sign agreements

### **Test Navigation:**
1. Employer should see: Dashboard, Agreements, Wallet in navbar
2. All links should work without errors
3. Dashboard quick actions should have correct links

## UI Improvements:

### **Login Page:**
- Role selection dropdown instead of disabled field
- Better user experience for both seekers and providers

### **Employer Dashboard:**
- Updated quick action links
- Added agreements access
- Fixed broken links

### **Navigation:**
- Clear separation between seeker and employer features
- Easy access to agreements for employers

The employer login and agreement viewing functionality is now fully working! üéâ

## Additional Notes:

- **Backward Compatibility**: Changes maintain compatibility with existing seeker login flow
- **Error Handling**: Proper fallbacks for missing employerId
- **User Experience**: Clear role selection and appropriate redirects
- **Navigation**: Intuitive access to employer-specific features
