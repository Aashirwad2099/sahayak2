# Authentication Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Missing Logout Functionality**
- **Problem**: No logout button in the UI, users couldn't sign out
- **Fix**: Added logout button to both Navbar and HamburgerMenu

### 2. **Inconsistent Authentication State**
- **Problem**: Components were using `localStorage.getItem('user')` directly instead of AuthContext
- **Fix**: Updated components to use `useAuth()` hook consistently

### 3. **Incomplete Logout Process**
- **Problem**: Logout wasn't clearing all localStorage items
- **Fix**: Enhanced logout function to clear all auth-related localStorage items

### 4. **Navigation Issues After Auth Actions**
- **Problem**: Using `window.location.href` instead of React Router navigation
- **Fix**: Updated to use `useNavigate()` hook for proper SPA navigation

## Files Modified:

### 1. **Navbar.jsx**
- Added `useAuth` hook
- Added logout button in the navbar
- Replaced localStorage access with AuthContext

### 2. **HamburgerMenu.jsx**
- Added `useAuth` hook
- Added logout option in hamburger menu
- Replaced localStorage access with AuthContext
- Added proper navigation handling

### 3. **EmployerDashboard.jsx**
- Updated to use `useAuth` hook instead of localStorage
- Consistent user data access

### 4. **LoginPage.jsx**
- Updated to use AuthContext `login` method
- Replaced `window.location.href` with `navigate()`
- Maintained backward compatibility with localStorage

### 5. **AuthContext.js**
- Enhanced logout function to clear all auth-related items:
  - `token`
  - `user`
  - `userId`
  - `selectedLanguage`

## How the Fixes Work:

### **Logout Flow:**
1. User clicks logout button (Navbar or HamburgerMenu)
2. `handleLogout()` function is called
3. AuthContext `logout()` method clears all localStorage items
4. User state is reset to null
5. User is redirected to login page

### **Login Flow:**
1. User submits login form
2. API call is made to authenticate
3. AuthContext `login()` method is called with user data and token
4. localStorage is updated for backward compatibility
5. User is redirected based on their skills status

### **Authentication State:**
- All components now use `useAuth()` hook
- Consistent user data access across the app
- Proper loading and authentication states

## Testing the Fixes:

1. **Login Test:**
   - Go to `/login`
   - Enter credentials and login
   - Should redirect to appropriate page
   - Navbar should show logout button

2. **Logout Test:**
   - Click logout button in navbar (desktop)
   - OR click hamburger menu ‚Üí logout (mobile)
   - Should clear all data and redirect to login
   - Should not be able to access protected routes

3. **Navigation Test:**
   - All navigation should work without page refreshes
   - Protected routes should redirect to login if not authenticated
   - Role-based access should work correctly

## UI Changes:

### **Navbar (Desktop)**
- Added red logout button on the right side
- Button appears only when user is authenticated

### **HamburgerMenu (Mobile)**
- Added logout option at the bottom of the menu
- Separated by a border for visual distinction
- Red text color to indicate logout action

The authentication system is now robust and provides a consistent user experience across all devices and components! üîê‚úÖ
